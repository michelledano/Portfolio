    <h1>Ferdinand Marcus</h1>
    <img src="img/Marcos.jpg">
    <p> (born September 11, 1917, Sarrat, Philippines—died September 28, 1989, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.), Philippine lawyer and politician who, as head of state from 1966 to 1986, established an authoritarian regime in the Philippines that came under criticism for corruption and for its suppression of democratic processes.</p>
    <p>Marcos attended school in Manila and studied law in the late 1930s at the University of the Philippines, near that city. Tried for the assassination in 1933 of a political opponent of his politician father, Marcos was found guilty in November 1939. But he argued his case on appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court and won acquittal a year later. He became a trial lawyer in Manila. During World War II he was an officer with the Philippine armed forces. Marcos’s later claims of having been a leader in the Filipino guerrilla resistance movement were a central factor in his political success, but U.S. government archives revealed that he actually played little or no part in anti-Japanese activities during 1942–45.</p>
    <p>From 1946 to 1947 Marcos was a technical assistant to Manuel Roxas, the first president of the independent Philippine republic. He was a member of the House of Representatives (1949–59) and of the Senate (1959–65), serving as Senate president (1963–65). In 1965 Marcos, who was a prominent member of the Liberal Party founded by Roxas, broke with it after failing to get his party’s nomination for president. He then ran as the Nationalist Party candidate for president against the Liberal president, Diosdado Macapagal. The campaign was expensive and bitter. Marcos won and was inaugurated as president on December 30, 1965. In 1969 he was reelected, becoming the first Philippine president to serve a second term. During his first term he had made progress in agriculture, industry, and education. Yet his administration was troubled by increasing student demonstrations and violent urban guerrilla activities.</p>

      <p>Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos, Sr. (December 30, 1965 – February 25, 1986) was a Filipino lawyer, politician, World War II veteran and kleptocrat who was President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He ruled as a dictator under martial law from 1972 until 1981. While his regime started an unprecedented number of infrastructure projects and monuments (known colloquially as an "edifice complex'" and at great taxpayer cost),it also became infamous for its corruption and brutality. Prior to his presidency, Marcos started out as an attorney before serving as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and of the Philippine Senate from 1959 to 1965, where he was also Senate President from 1963 to 1965. Marcos fought alongside with the Americans during the Japanese Invasion and participated in the Bataan Death March, and he would later claim during his election campaigns that he has been "the most decorated war hero in the Philippines", a claim which was later proven to be false. United States Army documents described the claim "fraudulent" and "absurd". However, President Fidel Ramos backed Marcos' claim that Marcos founded the anti-Japanese guerrilla group Maharlika and has mentioned in his presidential inaugural biography that his father Narciso Ramos served as one of the leaders of Marcos' guerrilla group.</p>
      <h2>Contributions of Pres. Marcos</h2>
      <p>During Marcos' first term, he had roads, bridges and other public works built throughout the Philippines. This was an important achievement since it provided services and transportation to many of the rural areas of the country. He also made the controversial decision to get the Philippines involved in the Vietnam War, allying with the United States. Marcos put into effect important economic reforms, including the development of industries in the Philippines that employed many workers and provided valuable trade goods. He was seen as an ambitious politician with an eye for future potential. During his subsequent terms as president, however, Marcos tightened his authoritarian grip on the Philippines. He filled his presidential cabinet with friends and family members and embezzled millions of dollars from the state treasury. When activists began to speak out against him, he had them imprisoned and killed. Two of them were even assassinated on United States soil in 1979.</p>
      <h2>TIMELINE</h2>
      <p>1965 Ferdinand E. Marcos is elected president of the Philippines</p>
      <p>1966 Marcos supports the US policy in Vietnam and despite opposition against his plan he manages to gain Congressional approval to send Philippine troops to Vietnam</p>
      <p>1969 As the first Filipino president to win a second term, Marcos is re-elected amidst allegations of electoral fraud. Muslim separatists in the south of the country begin their campaign of guerrilla war</p>
      <p>1970 Students in Manila mobilise huge numbers of people to attend protests against US imperialism and the "rise of fascism" under Marcos rule. This period of leftist unrest and demonstrations against the government became known as the "First Quarter Storm"</p>
      <p>1972 Marcos declares martial law on September 21, extending his rule beyond the constitutional two-term limit. He justifies his decision with threats of Communist and separatist Muslim insurgencies, and the allegedly staged assassination attempt of a government official. The parliament is suspended, opposition politicians and critics are arrested and censorship is imposed; the size of the Philippine military is increased and military officers are placed in high public and private positions</p>
      <p>1973 Marcos adopts a new constitution and consolidates his hold on power beyond 1973. Opposition leader Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino is arrested and charged with murder, subversion and illegal possession of firearms</p>
      <p>1977 After years in prison Aquino is sentenced to death. Marcos delays the execution</p>
      <p>1980 Aquino is allowed to travel to the US for medical treatment and stays there</p>
      <p>1981 Martial law is lifted. Marcos is re-elected as president</p>
      <p>1983 Aquino returns to the Philippines, but is shot dead at Manila airport as he leaves the plane. Many blame Marcos and the military for the murder, but no-one was ever punished for ordering the assassination</p>
      <p>1985 The nation is in political and economic chaos, with Marcos under attack by the media and the democratic opposition. Fifty-six assemblymen sign a resolution calling for the impeachment of Ferdinand Marcos for alleged diversion of US aid for personal use. A political movement is formed around Benigno Aquino's widow Corazon</p>
      <p>1986 Presidential elections see Marcos opposed by Aquino's widow, Corazon. Marcos is officially declared the winner, but Aquino disputes the result. Allegations of fraud and illegal tampering spark a popular uprising, dubbed "people power", in Manila. The military withdraws its support for Marcos who flees with his family to Hawaii. The new government under "Cory" Aquino claims Marcos had looted billions of dollars during his two decades in power</p>
      <p>1989 Seventy-two-year-old Ferdinand Marcos dies in exile in Hawaii after being hospitalised for nearly 10 months</p>
      <p>1989 US jets assist Philippine government forces in suppressing an attempted coup d'etat against the Aquino government in December</p>
      <p>1990 After a new government investigation, military officials are convicted of the murder of Benigno Aquino</p>
